# Kubernetes Manifests

The Kubernetes deployment manifests have been moved to the [examples/](../../examples/) directory for better organization.

## Quick Links

- **Single Cluster Deployment**: [examples/single-cluster/](../../examples/single-cluster/)
- **Multi-Cluster Deployment**: [examples/multi-cluster/](../../examples/multi-cluster/)

## What's Left Here

- `rbac.yaml` - RBAC configuration (also available in examples)
- `dnsendpoint-crd.yaml` - DNSEndpoint CRD definition (if using CRD mode)

These files are kept here for backwards compatibility but we recommend using the examples directory instead.
